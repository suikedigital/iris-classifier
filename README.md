# Iris Classifier

This project trains and evaluates machine learning models on the classic Iris dataset. It uses both a Decision Tree and a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier to predict iris species and outputs model performance metrics and confusion matrices.

## Features

- Load and split the Iris dataset
- Train Decision Tree and K-NN classifiers
- Generate accuracy scores and confusion matrices for each model
- Save trained models and results with timestamps
- Save confusion matrix plots as PNG images

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `joblib`

Install dependencies via:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib joblib
